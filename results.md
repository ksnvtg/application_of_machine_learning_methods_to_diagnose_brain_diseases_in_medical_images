After that, the entire dataset of patients was split into three subsets:
* 258 patients (69.9%) - training set (train.txt)
* 55 patients (14.9%) - validation set (val.txt)
* 56 patients (15.2%) - test set (test.txt)
Patients were randomly shuffled using a fixed random seed to ensure reproducibility. The split results were saved into text files for automatic loading during training, as illustrated in Fig 1.
