# Application of Machine Learning Methods for Diagnosing Brain Diseases in Medical Images

This thesis was completed by Oksana Yevtushenko, a student of the Department of Biomedical Cybernetics, Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, specialty "Computer Sciences", educational program "Computer Technologies in Biology and Medicine".

## Relevance

Diagnosis of brain diseases, particularly tumor, requires accurate and rapid analysis of medical images. Manual MRI analysis is time-consuming, depends on the physician's experience, and is prone to errors. Therefore, the use of deep learning methods, especially segmentation neural networks, is a promising direction to automate this process, increase diagnostic accuracy, and reduce medical staff workload.

## Aim and Objectives

The aim of this work is to develop a program that applies machine learning methods for diagnosing brain diseases using medical images.

### Objectives:

1. Collect and preprocess medical images for analysis.
2. Review modern approaches to automatic medical image processing.
3. Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) to upload, view, and segment images.
4. Implement automatic lesion area detection.
5. Test the program and analyze it`s perfomance.
6. Visualize segmentation results.
7. Evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness.
